BST- Binary Search Tree
-> The left node should be less than root node and right node should be grater than root node 
-> i.e L<root<R
-> If we have duplicates then we can consider it as L<=root<=right
-> the first condition should be applicable to every subtree in an binary search tree
-> we are moving to binary serach tree to reduce Time Complexity how?
-> where if you consider degenerate tree(skew tree) if you want to traverse through it takes lot of time i.e O(n) 
where as in BST The height of BST is generally it is O(logn) coz because of the BST rule we are finding an element and searching that particular 
element in a particular part
********************************************
Applications Of BST:
********************************
1. BST is used for easy seach in an efficient way
2. It is used Database indexing
3. It is used to implement the symbol tables
4. It used to implemented in fast automation Systems.
5. It used to store and quickly retrive the data
6. used in spell check,priority queue, data catching
**********************************************
Q-1: Search in BST:
you are given a BST tree and then val you have to find the where the value is if value doesnot found we can return null
step1: check if root is null return null
step2: check if root val is equal to given val then return root val (as this is a condition)
step3: check if val < root .val then call function by moving to root.left
step4: check if val> root.val then call function by moving to root.right
**************************************************************************
Q-2: Ceil in BST
you are given a root and key 
Ceil means you have return a smallest value which is greater that or equal to key
Floor means you have to return a greater value which is smaller than or equal to key
Step1: traverse through a tree untill root not equal null
step2: take ceil variable assign -1
step3: if root val == key ceil=root val
step4: if key< root.val then ceil=root.val move to root.left
step-5: if key> root.val then move to root.right
same process for floor step3 and 4 are reversed
